## The Emotional Intelligence Behind Music

While most music recommendation systems rely on genre or popularity, Carnatic Calm focuses on you — your mood, your energy, your stress levels — and suggests therapeutic ragas accordingly. This makes it perfect for:

- Emotional and mental wellness  
- Meditation and relaxation  
- Discovering Carnatic music  
- Music therapy exploration  

---

## Key Features

### Mood-to-Raga Mapping  
Enter your current state via 4 intuitive sliders:
- Stress
- Sleep Quality
- Anxiety
- Energy

Our internal scoring system computes a “mood index” and maps it to curated Carnatic ragas.

### Instant Audio Playback  
Stream short clips of the recommended ragas directly from the browser (ensure the `/audio/` folder contains relevant `.mp3` files).

### Theme Switch  
Toggle between light and dark modes to suit your environment and preference.

### Engaging UI  
Enjoy subtle animations like floating notes, twinkling stars, and even a rocket launch on the "Get Started" button.
